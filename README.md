## Introduction

This is a library app for user to borrow books, to manage book loans, to leave reviews and to post questions. Other features like online payment, admin service, I would develop them in next phrase.

This is a full stack app. The tech stacks contains TypeScript and React for frontend, Java and Spring (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data REST and JPA) for backend. I integrated Okta cloud identity solution rather than low-level coding to generate tokens and solve authorization, which is simple use and not vulnerable to security holes.
